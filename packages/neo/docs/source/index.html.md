# Introduction

Welcome to the NEO dAPI. This allows your decentralized application to connect to any NEO wallet which conforms to the dAPI standard. You no longer have to spend any time building out your own wallet, and can instead focus on making your application great. If you'd like to learn more about the use cases of this dAPI, please read below. Otherwise, feel free to skip directly to the method implementation starting with Read Methods.

## DAPI for End Users
As dApps come into the ecosystem, there will be more concerns about the safety of user assets. If dApps all required users to input their private keys in order to use them, it just takes one malicious dApp to steal all their funds. By using a trusted wallet provider which interfaces with the various dApps in the ecosystem on their behalf, users can reduce the exposure of their private keys. This will even allow users to transact with their hardware wallets via the wallet provider, never having to reveal their private keys even to the wallet itself.

## DAPI for dApp Developers
One of the initial hurtles for any developer when starting to develop a dApp is to create a wallet module that will allow the user and application to interface with the NEO blockchain. While there are many quality SDKs out there such as neon-js for facilitating the communication of these requests, there are often many hurtles to successfully constructing the right combination of methods, along with input and output parsing. The issue only gets amplified when trying to integrate with hardware wallet providers such as a Ledger device.

While there may be several options for 3rd party wallet providers that will help them to facilitate these transactions, the is currently no common consensus on the consistency of their interfaces. With a lack of consistency in interfaces to use these wallet provider services, dApp developers will be forced to make a decision to have their platform supported by a single provider, or to double or even triple their development efforts to accommodate all the different wallet provider interfaces. This will lead to a fragmentation in the dApps ecosystem.

## DAPI for Wallet Providers
Each wallet provider, when deciding on supporting dApps to utilize their services as an authentication mechanism will be faced with a decision on how to implement an API to communicate with the dApps. Wallet providers can choose to create their own API from scratch, create their own version of existing projects, or aim to directly duplication an existing API. In the case that the provider decides to make their own API interface from scratch, and try to promote dApps to use it, time and effort will inevitably be wasted by both the provider and competing providers on getting dApp developers on board with using their custom communication interface. If we have a unified interface for such transactions, providers can spend more time on making their individual services better for their users.

# Development Environment
This is a walkthrough of how to get setup in order to interact with O3 API's connecting to the NEO blockchain.

## O3 App Installation
Download and install the latest version of the latest versions of the O3 apps.


[O3 Desktop Installer](https://o3.network/)
Be sure to install the desktop version of the O3 application for development. Mobile support coming soon.


## O3 Setup

Open up the O3 app, and click the "Import existing wallet" button, or create a new wallet if you do not already have one.

![o3import](../images/o3Import.png)

![o3import2](../images/o3Import2.png)

Give the account a name, and a password to login to this account in the future.

![o3import3](../images/o3Import3.png)

You should now be logged into a wallet in O3. Please navigate to the apps screen by clicking on the apps icon in the toolbar on the left hand side.

![o3apps](../images/o3Apps.png)

Once on the apps screen, click on the title "Apps" rapidly 10 times to put the O3 app into developer mode.

![o3apptitle](../images/o3AppTitle.png)

You should notice that in dev mode you will now have access to the "Dev Settings" menu on the top right, and the addition of several developer apps to the app list.


## Testing the O3 API's (O3 dapi Testbed)

To get your feet wet, we provide a testbed that will let you interact with all the O3 API's


Now that your contract is deployed to your private net, we want to call it. When calling your contract in your dapp, you can use the O3 dapi with the Ontology plugin. To guide you in doing so, the O3 app in dev mode provides a app called "NEO dapi Testbed".

![o3neodapi](../images/neo-dapi.png)

Once open, you can test all the methods listed in this documentation in a sandboxed environment.

![ontneonet](../images/neo-dapp-browser-testbed.png)

For example, getProvider will give you information about the O3 wallet in a structured JSON format. Feel free to test out all of these methods to see how the User Flow will work on various methods. Some methods, like sending will require additonal user authentication from the wallet.


## Connecting to your own website

After testing out the methods in the testbed, you will likely want to connect to your own website. Navigate to the O3 Dev app in order to connect to your own custom URL.

![o3neodapidev](../images/neo-dapi-dev.png)

From here that you can test out your application with the O3 Wallet. Just install the inject the latest o3-dapi package located here for an easy way to access all dapi methods using javascript.

import o3dapi from 'o3-dapi-core';
import o3dapiNeo from 'o3-dapi-neo';

// Init the NEO plugin into the core dapi provider package
o3dapi.initPlugins([o3dapiNeo]);


o3dapi.NEO.getNetworks()
.then(networks => console.log(networks));
```

# Read Methods

Read methods do not alter the state of the blockchain. It can help you query information about your user, and provide you with relevant information:

## getProvider

```typescript
o3dapi.NEO.getProvider()
.then((provider: Provider) => {
  const {
    name,
    website,
    version,
    compatibility,
    extra,
  } = provider;

  const {
    theme,
  } = extra;

  console.log('Provider name: ' + name);
  console.log('Provider website: ' + website);
  console.log('Provider dAPI version: ' + version);
  console.log('Provider dAPI compatibility: ' + JSON.stringify(compatibility));
  console.log('Provider UI theme: ' + theme);
})
.catch(({type: string, description: string, data: any}) => {
  switch(type) {
    case NO_PROVIDER:
      console.log('No provider available.');
      break;
    case CONNECTION_DENIED:
      console.log('The user rejected the request to connect with your dApp.');
      break;
  }
});
```

# Events
Events are a way for the wallet to asynchronously with the DAPP when certain changes occur to the state of the wallet that might be relevant for the


## READY
On a READY event, the callback will fire with a single argument with information about the wallet provider. At any time a READY event listener is added, it will immidiately be called if the provider is already in a ready state. This provides a single flow for dapp developers since this listener should start any and all interactions with the dapi protocol.

| Parameter     | Type     | Description                                                      |

## addEventListener

```typescript
o3dapi.NEO.addEventListener(o3dapi.NEO.Constants.EventName.ACCOUNT_CHANGED, data => {
  console.log(`Connected Account: ${data.address}`);
});
```

Method is used to add a callback method to be triggered on a specified event.

## removeEventListener

```typescript
o3dapi.NEO.removeEventListener(o3dapi.NEO.Constants.EventName.ACCOUNT_CHANGED);
```

Method is to remove existing callback event listeners.
